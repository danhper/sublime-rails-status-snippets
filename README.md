# Rails Status Snippets for Sublime text

ST2/3 snippets for HTTP codes symbols in Ruby on Rails.

## Installation

Install the package as `Rails Status Snippets` through Package Control.


## Usage

These are basically only snippets, so you can get started straight away.

Instead of writing `:unprocessable_entity`, you can use `s422`+tab,
or `s500`+tab for `:internal_server_error`.

This works for all the codes listed in http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#the-status-option
